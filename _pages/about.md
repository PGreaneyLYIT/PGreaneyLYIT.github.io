I am a lecturer in the Department of Computing at Atlantic Technological University Donegal - Letterkenny Campus, where I supervise MSc and PhD students, and teach on the [MSc in Data Science](https://www.lyit.ie/CourseDetails/D303/NC1080/DataScience&PreparatoryCertificateinComputing), [MSc in Big Data Analytics & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.lyit.ie/CourseDetails/D303/LY_KDAAI_M/BigDataAnalyticsandArtificialIntelligence), [BSc in Cyberpsychology](https://www.lyit.ie/CourseDetails/D303/NC2081/BScHonsinCyberpsychology), and [Diploma in Applied Data Technologies](https://www.lyit.ie/portals/0/PDF/atu/springboard/2022DiplomainAppliedDataTechnologies.pdf) courses. 

Prior to this, I spent three years as a research engineer at [Valeo Vision Systems](https://www.valeo.com/en/), working on deep learning algorithms for computer vision.
Before that, I completed a PhD in Applied Mathematics, in the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at the University of Galway. I completed a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in Galway in 2014.
