Since September 2021, I am a lecturer in the Department of Computing at Letterkenny Institute of Technology. Prior to this, I spent three years as a research engineer at Valeo Vision Systems, working on deep learning algorithms for computer vision.

From 2014 to 2018, I was a PhD student in the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at NUI Galway. My thesis, entitled Thinning Instabilities in Biological and Electroactive Membranes, was defended in February 2019. I completed my B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in Galway in 2014.
