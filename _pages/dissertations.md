I am available to supervise a limited number of dissertations on the MSc programmes in Data Science, Big Data Analytics, and BDA & Artificial Intelligence. 
If you are interested in working under my supervision, you should contact me in good time, ahead of the project proposal deadline.  

One area worth examining is in projects which align with the United Nations [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). 
Topics which are of interest include
 * Crop yield prediction using weather data
 * Forecasting and tracking air quality
 * Applications of machine learning to transport, including traffic forecasting, public transport demand and optimisation
