I am available to supervise a limited number of dissertations on the MSc programmes in Data Science and BDA & Artificial Intelligence. 
If you are interested in working under my supervision, you should contact me in good time, ahead of the project proposal deadline. A list of dissertations I've previously supervised is available <a href="https://paulgreaney.github.io/teaching/dissertations" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />

One thing worth considering is aligning your dissertation topic with the United Nations <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. <br /><br />

Some topics which would be of interest:
<ul>
<li>Finding solutions to differential equations using deep learning</li>
<li>Applications of neural differential equation models</li>
<li>Crop yield prediction using climate data
<li>Forecasting and tracking air quality
<li>Applications of machine learning to transport, including traffic forecasting, public transport demand and optimisation
<li>Sentiment analysis for public and political opinion
<li>Effects of annotation quality on ML model performance
</ul>
<br />

<a href="https://paperswithcode.com/" target="_blank">Papers with Code</a> is a useful repository of machine learning papers together with their with code implementations.

Some useful sources of data include:
<ul>
  <li>Ireland's <a href="https://data.gov.ie/" target="_blank">Open Data Portal</a>
  <li> The EU's <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en" target="_blank">European Data Portal</a>
</ul>

A LaTeX dissertation template is available on Overleaf <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/vhbhpxdsrnjx" target="_blank">here</a>.
