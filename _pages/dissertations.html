I am available to supervise a limited number of dissertations on the MSc programmes in Data Science, Big Data Analytics, and BDA & Artificial Intelligence. 
If you are interested in working under my supervision, you should contact me in good time, ahead of the project proposal deadline.<br>

One area worth examining is in projects which align with the United Nations [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). <br>

Some topics related to this which are of interest include:
<ul>
<li>Crop yield prediction using weather data
<li>Forecasting and tracking air quality
<li>Applications of machine learning to transport, including traffic forecasting, public transport demand and optimisation
</ul>
